","body":"# Fast-Parallel-Tools-for-Genome-wide-Analysis-of-Genomic-Divergence\r\nMaster's Thesis carried out at the Biomedicial Informatics (BMI) research group at the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo. \r\n\r\nThe thesis can be found at:\r\n\r\nIn this thesis we have implemented tools for comparative genomics, with two different methods for \r\ndiverting regions in the genome of two populations, a Fisher's Exact Test (FET) and a Cluster Separation Score (CSS). \r\nFor CSS, three different methods for calculating multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) are implemented. The tools are implemented as web tools on the Genomic HyperBrowser, https://hyperbrowser.uio.no/comparative/,\r\nusing Python, Cython and C, and the code is parallelized with Pthreads. \r\n\r\nThis thesis extends and improves a master's thesis by Torkil Vederhus, that can be found at: \r\nhttp://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-39032.\r\n\r\nVederhus (2013) wrote several tools for the Genomic HyperBrowser, https://hyperbrowser.uio.no/comparative/:\r\n- Fisher Exact Test SNP Tool\r\n- Filter Fisher Scores\r\n- Cluster Separation Score\r\n- Significant CSS Regions\r\n- Convert Stickleback Snps to Gtrack\r\n\r\nand two statistics, one for each method, FET and CSS:\r\n\r\n- CategoryClusterSeparationStat\r\n- FisherExactScoreStat\r\n\r\nand I have made larger and smaller changes to his tools. The largest modificantions are done on the statistics,\r\nwhile the web tools have smaller changes. \r\n\r\nI have created a new tool, for converting VCF files to the GTrack format used by these tools:\r\n- Convert VCF To Gtrack Tool\r\n\r\nAll the C and Cython files are created by me. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
